# Harnessing AI in Research, Data Science, and Coding

## Introduction
This repository provides resources and demos related to using AI for Research, using AI for Data Science, and AI-assisted coding. In addition, the presentation also provides a list of AI tools. Sample prompts for (1) Kaggle Housing Price Regressions and (2) Kaggle Taylor Swift Song Analysis are also included, together with generated Jupyter Notebooek from (1). This demonstrates how to use data science agent to generate data science codes. 

### Topics Covered:
1. AI in Research
2. AI in Data Science 
3. AI-Assisted Coding
4. AI Tools
